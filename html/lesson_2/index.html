        <strong>SpongeBob SquarePants</strong> is an American animated comedy television series created by marine science
        educator and
        animator Stephen Hillenburg
        for Nickelodeon. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character and his aquatic friends in the
        fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Being the fifth-longest-running American animated series, its high
        popularity has made it a media franchise. It is the highest rated series to air on Nickelodeon as well as the most
        profitable property for ViacomCBS Consumer Products, having generated over $13 billion in merchandising revenue as
        of 2019.
    </p>
    <p>Many of the series' ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an unpublished educational book that Hillenburg created
        in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life.[5] He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television
        series in 1996, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. The network's executives wanted
        SpongeBob to be a child in school, but Hillenburg preferred SpongeBob to be an adult character.[6] He was prepared
        to "walk out" on Nickelodeon and abandon the series, but he compromised by creating Mrs. Puff and her boating
        school, so that SpongeBob could attend school as an adult
    </p>
    <p>Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, 1999, after it aired the 1999 Kids' Choice
        Awards. The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical acclaim since its
        premiere and had gained enormous popularity by its second season. The thirteenth season began airing in October
        2020.[8] The series has inspired three feature films: The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie in 2004, Sponge Out of Water
        in 2015, and Sponge on the Run in 2020. Two spin-off series, Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years and The Patrick
        Star Show, premiered in 2021. An additional spin-off, an untitled project based on the character Squidward
        Tentacles, is in development as of 2020.
    </p>
    <p>SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy
        Awards, 18 Kids' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA Children's Awards. A Broadway musical based on the series opened in
        2017 to critical acclaim.

    <p>Series' creator Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean as a child and began developing his
        artistic abilities at a young age. Although these interests would not overlap for some time—the idea of drawing fish
        seemed boring to him—Hillenburg pursued both during college, majoring in marine biology and minoring in art. After
        graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating
        the public about marine science and maritime history.[28][29] While Hillenburg was there, his love of the ocean
        began to influence his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal
        Zone used by the institute to teach visiting students about the animal life of tide pools.[29] The comic starred
        various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into SpongeBob SquarePants characters.[30]
        Hillenburg tried to get the comic professionally published, but none of the companies he sent it to were
        interested.[29] A large inspiration to Hillenburg was Ween's 1997 album The Mollusk, which had a nautical and
        underwater theme. Hillenburg contacted the band shortly after the album's release, explaining the baseline ideas for
        SpongeBob SquarePants, and also requested a song from the band, which they sent on Christmas Eve. This song was
        "Loop de Loop", which was used in the episode "Your Shoe's Untied
